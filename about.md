Hello! My name is Matt Knight and I'm a human, I like to do system programming,
organize events, and fight.

I'm active in the Zig programming language community, most notably I'm a
founder of the [Zig Embedded Group](https://github.com/ZigEmbeddedGroup). I've
also run a couple embedded workshops. 

In June 2023 I organized [Software You Can Love
2023](https://softwareyoucanlove.ca) in my home city, Vancouver.
