Hello! My name is Matt Knight. I like systems programming, organizing events,
and fighting.

I'm active in the Zig programming language community, most notably I'm a
co-founder of the [Zig Embedded Group](https://github.com/ZigEmbeddedGroup).
I've also run a couple embedded workshops. 

In June 2023 I organized [Software You Can Love
2023](https://softwareyoucanlove.ca) in my home city, Vancouver.
