_This post is part of a number that I've written as I complete Advent of Code
exercises. The purpose is to practice taking notes for other people as I solve a
problem, and to get used to writing and publishing a post on a nearly daily
basis._

## [Part 1](https://git.sr.ht/~mattnite/aoc-2023/tree/main/item/src/01_trebuchet/a.zig)

This one is a text processing problem. You scan each line, and concatenate the
first digit with the last digit, then sum each line to get your answer.

```
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```

The edge case my first implementation ran into was when a line only has one
digit, my indexing logic assumed that there would always be two numbers per
line. Of course that if there's only one, it is both the first and last digit.
With that fixed I found my answer.

## [Part 2](https://git.sr.ht/~mattnite/aoc-2023/tree/main/item/src/01_trebuchet/b.zig)

Now we have to consider numbers that are spelled out as well:

```
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
```

For the first line the number would be 29. The best approach I can think up for
this one is to break up a line into chunks of individual digits and sequences
of letters, then search those sequences of letters for spelled out numbers.

For the implementation I could see people making some sort of mixed
digit/letter number iterator. For ours we're going to scan the line one by one,
toss found digits into a list, transforming any spelled out ones into numbers
as well. Then from there we just grab the first and last entry.

To break our chunks of letters into single digits, we're going to iterate
forwards through the list and check against a lookup table of our spelled out
digits 0-9. There's lots of room for performance improvements here.

### Overlapping digits

I made an assumption that spelled out digits would not overlap, looking through
some logs of the parsing results, nothing obvious stands out and I'm being told
that I have the wrong answer. I do see this entry in my logging though:

```
info: line: sjtwonesix6cqbv4
info: list: 2664
```

Here there's the sub-string `twonesix` and it's being parsed as `26`. I bet that
they want that parsed as `216`.

That did the trick.
